    _We call our implementation of Datajam "Sunlight Live." Designed to match our main site, Sunlight Live features a fluid/responsive design, video, data cards and chat, and an integrated administrative console. The page notifies users of new messages and makes it a cinch to update the page with new data cards._

- #### Live, Moderated Chat
    ![Live Chat](/img/img_liveChat.jpg)

    _Our chat system was built from the ground up to make it easy to monitor and curate incoming messages. URLs in messages are automatically shortened through bit.ly (the system can use your Bit.ly API if you have one), and can be shared with one click to Twitter._

    _Our data cards are what really separate Datajam from other real-time reporting platforms. Cards can be easily created using data from our Influence Explorer site, or the can be custom built with CSV or HTML. Switching the cards is simple: you just select them from a menu during the event and they are instantly updated for all viewers._
