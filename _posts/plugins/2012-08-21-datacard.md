## Datacard

Data cards are snippets of HTML that can be flipped in real-time like a
slideshow. This plugin provides the framework for creating, managing and
selecting cards while producing an event.

### Installation

Installation is the same as any Datajam Plugin -- Add the git url to your
`Pluginfile`, run `bundle` and deploy your application:

    gem 'datajam-datacard', git: 'https://github.com/sunlightlabs/datajam-datacard.git', require: 'datajam/datacard'

Then select 'actions > install' from the plugin's detail page at /admin/plugins/datajam-datacard.

### Creating cards

Datacard adds a navigation section with 2 links to your admin site. The first
link, 'Data Cards' is where you'll manage your cards. To create a new card, expand the
'New Card' drop down and choose which kind of data you'd like to create your card from.

#### Common Fields

There are three fields at the top of every new card form: title, tag string and source.
These are relatively self-explanitory, but be sure to note that the tag field
will auto-complete with tags you have already used on other cards, and that the source
field is for citing where the data came from, and is optional.

![Common fields](/img/datacard/commonfields.png)

#### Plain HTML

The simplest and most flexible type of card is just a plain HTML snippet. You can
use this type to do anything that is possible in HTML, from images to iframe embeds
to complex javascript. You can even embed a screen share widget in a datacard for producing
live webinars or screencasts.

**jQuery**

jQuery is included at the top of your Site template (as a part of the
`{{'{{{'}} head_assets }}}` tag), so there's no need to include it again.
The `jQuery` global will be available to you immediately, before the DOM has loaded.

**Require.js**

Require JS is available to data cards at DOM ready so you should
gather any dependencies your HTML card might have using require:

    <script>
    (function($){
      $(function(){
        require(['https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/0.9.2/backbone-min.js'], function(){
          // do stuff that requires backbone here
        });
      });
    })(jQuery);
    </script>

#### CSV

Datacard's CSV functionality makes it easy to draw tables and charts from a
CSV file, or even from hand-entered CSV into a code editor area in the create form.

You do not need to fill out the CSV data field if you are uploading a file, and once
your CSV file is parsed it will be discarded and its data will be displayed
in the text area for future editing.

#### Remote Data Sources

![Remote data sources](/img/datacard/remotedata.png)

Datacard provides a simple DSL for mapping remote data services (ReST APIs) to
query forms, to make it easy for producers to query data and create tables and
charts. On the code side, we call these sources 'mappings.' A list of installed
mappings can be found under the 'Data Sources' link in the Datacard menu. By default,
a mapping for Sunlight's Influence Explorer API is installed, and additional
mappings, if available, can be installed by adding them to your `Pluginfile`. Because
each mapping is different and its use will likely require a basic understanding of the data
being queried, the process for requesting data from a remote source isn't really
documentable in detail, but it's as simple as filling out a web form. The display side
of the process will be described below in the section on
[Table/Chart Display Settings](#table_chart_display_settings).

Likewise, Describing the DSL is out of the scope of this document, but if you're
at all familiar with Ruby our [Influence Explorer example](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/datacard-influence-explorer)
should be quite easy to read.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>
    <strong>Data Source Settings</strong>: Be sure to check to see if your data source
    has any settings available! Many APIs require access keys, and a mapping's settings
    page is where you'll find a place to add yours.
    </p>
</div>

#### 'Duplicating' Cards

Cards based on a data set (CSV or Remote Data) can be 'duplicated,' which is to say
that multiple cards can share a single data set. This can be useful for having some
collection of data in both chart and table forms, or showing a 'top 5' and a 'top 50'
independently, or sorting by or including different criteria. The admin interface will
warn you if you are editing a card that has shared data, in which case making changes
may affect multiple cards.

#### Table/Chart Display Settings

At the bottom of the edit forms of CSV and Remote Data cards you will find a section
for 'columns and sorting.' These properties unique to each card:

- Display type:
    _Required._ Select from table or column (vertical bar) chart.

- Group By field:
    _Not used for tables._ In a chart, you may wish to do simple aggregation
    of a column in your data. For example, if you have a list of contributions
    to political candidates and want to total the amounts for each party, you
    could select 'party' as a group by field, assuming such a field exists in your data.

- Sort By field:
    _Optional._ Likewise, the data you get may be sorted by date, and perhaps you want to sort
    by amount instead. Select 'amount' as the Sort By field in this case.

- Sort Order:
    _Optional._ Choose from ascending or descending.

- Series Fields:
    _Optional_. If you have selected a Group By field for a chart, series fields are the
    numeric values that should be summed to draw the bars in your chart. So if you
    have grouped by party and want to know the total amount, choose 'amount' as a
    series field. You can have multiple series, so long as they are all numeric.

- Number of rows:
    _Optional._ This field determines the number of rows to include in any calculation or
    display after sorting.

#### Converting Card Formats

CSV and Remote Data cards can be converted into other formats. For example, a card
based on Influence Explorer data might need a couple of slight tweaks, and can be
converted to CSV or HTML in order to make them. Likewise, a CSV card can be converted
to HTML. These are one-way conversions, meaning that the underlying csv or form data will
be discarded when a conversion is done. If a card with a shared data set is converted,
the data set will be kept intact and will remain associated with the other cards that
used it. Otherwise, it will be deleted.

### Producing an Event with Datacards

Displaying datacards is simple, just choose the card to display from the 'data card' modal
in on-air mode, and click the 'update' button.

![Select a card](/img/datacard/select.png)

All of the cards with tags that intersect
your event's tags, as well as all cards tagged 'global' will be present in your data card list.
When new datacards are created, a producer may need to refresh their event page to
see them.
